# Server Implementation
Simple express server api to serve up json data with an array of preset number
Did not use typescript for the server...

# Folder Structure:

* server          #mostly boilerplate
* /routes/v1/     # 2 routes /data1 or /data2
*   /index        # home route... try it on in your browser http://localhost:3000 a little humor ;-)
*   /data         #responsible for routing request to the correct controller 
* /controllers    #acts like a middleware to return the repsonse and or error message using axios response codes
* /services       #there's nothing really going on here since it's just return a static json object
* /db             #imports and returns json file 


# App Structure

## STYLING

** A custom styling architecture is implemented to avoid inline styles as much as possible

*All styles used are memoized when using mergeStyles from /utils/styles/merge-styles*
*a custom screen size scalling method is added moderateScale /utils/styles/scaling helpful for sizing text across multiple devices*
*typography, colors, layout are all controlled in the /theme folder *


## COMMON COMPONENT
* /components
* Button
* Gauge =>"Tile"
* Text
* TextField => TextInput
* Dashboard

## SCREENS => Containers
* /screens
* Home 

** Folder structures are setup with each component having a named file and an index file for export this system helps when you have multiple files open
You don't have a bunch of "index" files in your editor
This also allows you to keep your any presets, props, and test files contained within **


# Testing suite
- [x] yarn test
* using jest and enzyme

** Several test don't pass didn't have time to finish **

** Used typescript as much as possible time constaints forced me to get sloppy to get it done on time **
